  I MESSED UP! I learned that the memorial number is for us to be able to cross reference the individual form with the burial form, which I did not do! And I don't know how to go back and add that information. So later on when I go collect more data I will be sure to do that step correctly. (sorry for the confusing data Dr. Graham)
